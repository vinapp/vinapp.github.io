I am a Cloud Architect & a Full stack developer. Extensively worked on cloud platforms/technologies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure Cloud, IBM Cloud Platform, Mobile, Cloud Foundry, Docker, DevOps, Java/J2EE, Android. I am a AWS Certified Solution Architect.

I have a deep passion for India's rich cultural heritage, diverse linguistic landscape, and unique art, architecture, music, and yoga traditions and I believe that there are significant opportunities to utilize science and technology (such as DataScience/AI/Machine learning) to address challenges specific to India while also potentially benefiting the global community.
